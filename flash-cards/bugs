bugs:
* The Added card without definitions should be easier to regenerate (no need to go to edit). Or maybe auto-regenerate on open?
* On the reader view the buttons at the bottom are hard to click on my mobile device (they are too close to the edge).
* We should log each flash card game and collect stats on the cards that are missed the most.
* Should make unified tags view everywhere.
* Color code the tones?
* integrate better payment instead of byok. 
* Opening settings, pressing esc - goes back instead of closing settings only
