    "meaning": "不 is the basic Chinese adverb used to negate verbs, adjectives, and sometimes whole clauses. It means “not,” “no,” or functions like the English prefix “un-” (as in “unhappy”). It states that something does not happen, is not true, or is the opposite of an affirmative statement.",
    "components": "不 is written with a horizontal stroke on top and additional strokes below (traditional analysis sometimes treats it as ⿱一③: a top “one” stroke over three more strokes). Historically it was a pictograph related to a bird’s footprint or a mark, but in modern Chinese it functions purely as a standalone character meaning “not / no,” not as a semantic radical for other meanings.",

It can also add emphasis to what comes before.

Historically it’s a simple pictographic form that later took on abstract grammatical functions.

For learners, you can think of the top hook (乛) as a ‘turn’ or ‘change’, and the lower hook (亅) as a ‘stop’ or ‘finish’, together hinting at “something has turned and come to an end,” which fits the idea of completion or change of state.",
