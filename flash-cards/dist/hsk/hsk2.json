    "microClue": "soft question or suggestion",
    "meaning": "吧 has two main uses: (1) As a modal particle pronounced “ba”, placed at the end of a sentence to soften tone, make a suggestion, or show uncertainty, similar to “…right?”, “…OK?”, or “I guess…”. (2) As “bā”, it can mean a bar (as in bar, café, or online forum), or be part of onomatopoeia like a smack or bang.",
    "components": "吧 is ⿰口巴: 口 (mouth) suggests speaking or sounds; 巴 (to cling; also used in many characters) hints at attaching or tagging something on. Put together, a ‘mouth’ plus ‘巴’ gives a sound or tone that ‘clings’ to the end of what you say—an ending particle or a sound like “bang/smack”.",
