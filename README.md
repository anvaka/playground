# playground

Just a set of experiments that I want to play with, but they are too small to be in their own repository.


Please ignore this repository - there is a lot of ruins here, but things that I
like, I eventually release as standalone projects. Some graduates from this place are:

* [ngraph.path](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.path)
* [fieldplay](https://github.com/anvaka/fieldplay)
* [common-words](https://github.com/anvaka/common-words)
* [e-sum](https://github.com/anvaka/e-sum)
* [peak map](https://github.com/anvaka/peak-map)
* [vs](https://github.com/anvaka/vs)
* [go-mo-ku](https://github.com/anvaka/go-mo-ku)
