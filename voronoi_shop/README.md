# Coffee Shop Voronoi Map

This interactive web application visualizes coffee shops in cities using Voronoi diagrams. The app fetches coffee shop locations from OpenStreetMap and creates a beautiful, colorful Voronoi partition of the city map where each cell represents the area closest to a particular coffee shop.

## Features

- **City-Based Search**: Enter any city name to visualize its coffee shops
- **Voronoi Diagram Generation**: Automatically partitions the city map based on coffee shop locations
- **Beautiful Visualization**: Includes artistic rendering with smooth gradients and color palettes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive UI**: Hover over cells to see coffee shop information
- **Multiple Renderer Support**: Includes both SVG and Canvas rendering options

## How It Works

1. The application fetches city boundary data using the Nominatim API
2. Coffee shop locations are retrieved using the OpenStreetMap Overpass API
3. A Voronoi diagram is generated from the coffee shop coordinates
4. The diagram is rendered within the city boundaries with a pleasing color scheme

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language
- **D3.js**: For Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram generation
- **Fetch API**: For making requests to OpenStreetMap services
- **SVG/Canvas**: For rendering the visualization
- **CSS3**: For styling and transitions

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Enter a city name and click the search button
4. Explore the coffee shop Voronoi diagram

## Configuration

You can modify the following settings in `script.js`:

- `RENDERER_TYPE`: Choose between 'svg' and 'canvas' renderers
- `COLOR_SCHEME`: Choose between 'muted', 'sunset', and 'blues' color palettes
